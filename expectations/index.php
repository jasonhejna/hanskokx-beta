<h2>What is it like to work with you?</h2>
From start to finish, I strive to build a lasting relationship with you.  I want to be there for your graduation, your engagement, the wedding, your first born, and even your anniversary.  There is no better photographer than one that knows you and your family well; the relationship that we build together through our venture will only shine through in the output of subsequent sessions.
<br /><br />
Our sessions will be fun, light, and easy going.  We can explore a plethora of wardrobe choices, hair styles, and locations to find what suits the occasion best, and all of the photographs taken will be treated with the utmost amount of care and personal attention.  Each photo shot will be treated as though it was one of my very own!
<br /><br />
It is my goal to provide you with exactly what you need.  From the start, I don't want to upsell you on something you don't need - I want you to have the right service or package to fit your needs.  If you are curious of other services that I offer, you need simply inquire.  Without the sales pitch, I will explain what options are available to you.  Times are tough, and we need to look out for one another.  And yes, I work from a signed contract, but that doesn't mean you're not allowed to change your mind.  Things change - I realize this.  So, if you need to make some modifications to the plan by adding a service, changing the number of pages in your album, changing the date of your engagement or bridal portrait, or whatever else you can think of, I will do what is possible to accommodate your request.  And, if not, I'd better have a pretty darn good reason.

<h2>What happens during a typical session?</h2>
See the tabs above for specifics on different types of engagements.
<br /><br />
<h2>What happens after a session?</h2>
Every session is different, but typically I will comb through the hundreds of images that I have likely shot, and pull out some of the best for you to proof.  All proofing is done online, via a password protected and private viewing area.  When you have chosen the final images, they will be digitally post processed, and any requested blemishes or marks will be removed.  Upon final payment, digital copies will be provided on a CD, and any additional print copies can be purchased.  If you would like an album, or another type of print media, a price can be negotiated at that time.  Additional services may be available &agrave; la carte.  Payment is due typically 30 days after the session, although some special cases may exist.
