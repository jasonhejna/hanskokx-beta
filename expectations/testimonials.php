		Hans was our photographer for our engagement photos and we couldn't have chosen a better person for the job! He was full of ideas and was always willing to try our ideas. The photo quality and creativity was outstanding. We would definitely recommend him!<br /><br />

		Hans really went the extra mile for my fiancé and me during our recent engagement photo shoot, coming in from out of state and enduring a bitterly cold and occasionally precipitating outdoor session. He skillfully produced good photos in decidedly unfavorable conditions, all with confident professionalism and engaging humor. Next time I need a photographer, he’ll be my first choice.<br /><br />
