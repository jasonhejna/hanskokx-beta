	<h2>The Wedding</h2>
		On your Big Day, I want to be there to capture every emotion to cherish and share for a lifetime.  I love weddings!  They are overflowing with happiness and emotion, and have some of the best reactions from people.  Weddings truly are a photographer's playground.
			<br /><br />
		There are two types of wedding photography, right now: traditional and photojournalism.  Traditional wedding photography consists of posed shots, and formals with the staple shots you see from other wedding photos.  The photojournalistic approach is much more candid and hands off than the traditional style.  The goal of a photojournalistic approach is to capture unscripted moments as they happen.  This method is far less intrusive, which means that the shots are authentic, but it is also exceptionally difficult since anything can happen at any time, and location is everything.
			<br /><br />
		Traditional photography is further broken down into two types: documentary style (just taking a picture), and artistic style (adding a creative element).  Posed artistic wedding photography shots are great in the sense that the photographer has control over every aspect of the picture, and is only limited by his or her vision.  Documentary style strives to capture the moment for what it was.
			<br /><br />
		Compromises can be made between traditional photography and photojournalism, by combining the two.  This can be accomplished in a couple of ways.  First, the lead photographer can pose a shot, and a second photographer can capture images candidly off to the side.  Another compromise is posed photojournalism, where the couple acts as if the shot is unscripted.  This generally gives the photographer more control over the image, while still getting the attractive, natural look of photojournalism.

	<h3>Can we have pictures taken before the ceremony?</h3>
		Absolutely!  I love capturing that first reaction of the groom seeing the bride for the first time in her gorgeous dress! If you choose, we can set up a time where just the two of you can have a moment of relaxation before you walk down the aisle to say "I do" while we capture the emotions as they happen.  I can also take as many formal photos before the ceremony that you want.

	<h3>What about post-wedding portraits?</h3>
		Hey, I get it! The wedding is your time to shine, and can often be very busy for both the bride and groom.  This is not a problem!  As I strive to please, we can set up a post-wedding portrait session within 60 days of your wedding.  This gives the bride a chance to play dress-up one last time, and every detail can be perfect - the weather, the location, makeup, and every other little detail.  This service can typically be offered free of charge, depending on travel.
