<h2>The Engagement</h2>
Congratulations!  He brought the ring, and she said yes! Today is the most important day of your new life together, second only to the wedding!  I know you have a lot to plan for, so let me help make the engagement session as simple as possible for you.  After our initial correspondence, where I may ask you some general questions, we will generally have a sit-down meeting (or a telephone meeting, if you're prohibitively far away) to determine the when and the where of our session.<br /><br />
If you plan to use a photo from your engagement session in your announcements, you will want to schedule your session about a month before you want to order invitations.  If you want me to design "save the dates", I recommend about five months before the wedding, so we can design and get you the "save the dates" at about four months before your wedding to send them out.  Otherwise, plan on having your session at least three months before your wedding day.
